Question1: tell me about your experience with Always on and cluster installation.
Answer1: you can tell like

      Always on was introduced in SQL server 2012 version and it is a replacement for mirroring and clustering. It is available for both HA & DR.
      Here, clustering is an instance level feature, always on is database level feature.
      Clustering is mainly for HA, not for DR. Always on is both for HA & DR.
