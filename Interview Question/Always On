Answer: 
- For SQL 2022 & above: Contained Databases
- We can use dbatools (powershell module) using "copy-dbalogin"
- We can use sp_revlogin script out logins to secondary from primary.

Scenario1: changes on primary, but not done on secondary.

SQ1: How will you check for jobs that should run only on PRIMARY,not SECONDARY? 
Answer: A Customised script, if job is on PRIMARY SERVER, IT WILL EXECUTE, ELSE NO.

Answer: dbatools--Copy-dbajob: to copy logins between primary & secondary servers in Alwas On AG

SQ3: how to sync logins across all replicas from primary server?
Answer: dbatools--copy-dbalogin: to copy logins between primary & secondary servers in Alwas On AG

SQ4: Have you added SSISDB & sync across all Replicas for using SSIS packages?
Answer: All SSIS packages will be in SSISDB and add this DB in always on, so all replicas will have a copy of SSISDB with all packages.

SQ5: How do you patch the replicas & primary servers?
Answer:
- While doing a failover, we have to change to SYNC mode.
- Failover mode should be MANUAL.
- Once patching is done on SECONDARY, wait for Data sync, only then failover to another instance.
- Use GUI for Failover as it checks various parameters in the background.
- Jobs: Make sure no scheduled jobs are executed during patching duration.
- If our servers are NOT PHYSICAL, windows team can take SNAPSHOT of entire server

SQ6: What is URL Routing / Read only Routing for Always On and what needs to be done from Database end?
