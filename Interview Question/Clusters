Interview Questions: FCI (Failover Cluster Instance)
---------------------------------------------------------
1. what is
  - is alive,
  - like alive
Answer:
- IsAlive and LooksAlive are health checks performed by the Windows Server Failover Cluster (WSFC) to monitor the active node's SQL Server instance and detect failures for failover decisions.
- The LooksAlive : 
	> check verifies the basic status of the SQL Server service on the active node every 5 seconds by default
- IsAlive Check
	> The IsAlive check performs a more thorough health assessment by executing sp_server_diagnostics or a simple query like SELECT @@SERVERNAME to ensure SQL Server accepts connections and reports no critical issues. 

2. 1) Can we rename named instance name in SQL server? 
Answer: - No
        Note that Instance Name rename is unsupported. In named instance the server name is in format of ServerName\InstanceName. So, you can change it to NewName\InstanceName but NOT to ServerName\ NewInstanceName.

3) what factors detemine the UNGRACEFUL behaviour of cluster nodes?
- depends on the parameters set in cluster node's configuration.
- i.e specify the no of times cluster service will attempt to restart or failover clustered role in specific period.
  >> Max failures in specified period
  >> period (hours)

  Fallback
  - Allow Fallback
	  >> immediately
	  >> Feedback between
