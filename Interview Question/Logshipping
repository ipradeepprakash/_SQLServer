- If STANDY mode is chosen as restoring mode, then users have to be disconnected during restore of logs, which affects the reporting tasks for users.

2) Can we consider Log shipping as reporting solution?
    - Yes, but there will be delay while log backups restore. user connections will get killed, so user will have to connect again. lengthy reports are not suitable for log shipping.
