Enhancements: AlwaysOn Availability Groups: 
--------------------------------------------
Always On Basic Availability Groups :  

	- for Std edition, to failover to single database.  
	- With only 1 primary & 1 Secondary ,  
	- no read access on secondary,  
	- only 1 db availability,  
	- no backups on secondary,  
	- no listener on availability group 

Support for group Managed Service Accounts (gMSAs): 

	- Microsoft enhanced Windows Server 2012 so that you can more easily manage passwords for a service account in Active Directory by creating a single service account for your SQL Server instances and then delegating permissions to each of those servers.  
	- In SQL Server 2012 and SQL Server 2014, you can implement this feature only in standalone configurations 
	- In SQL Server 2016, you can now use gMSAs with both availability groups and failover clusters.  
	- If you are using Windows Server 2012 R2 as your operating system, you must install KB298082 to ensure that services can seamlessly log on after a password change. However, no patches are required if you install SQL Server 2016 on Windows Server 2016. 

  - Database-level failover: 
      > using sp_server_diagnostics stored procedures in SQL server 2012, 2014 automatic failover was happening at server level, but in SQL server 2016, individual level failover can be made possible. 
  - Distributed Transaction Coordinator (DTC) support: 
      > DTC is a feature that allows your app to perform transactions that must be consistent across multiple instances. Earlier it was available on FCI (failover cluster instances) now on availability groups per database. 
  - Load balancing for readable secondary replicas:  
  - Up to three automatic failover targets:  
  - Improved log transport performance:
