SQL Server 2005: New Features 
******************************

New features: 
------------------------

1. Tempdb : Beginning with SQL Server 2005, itâ€™s possible for SQL Server to cache temporary object definitions so that they can be reused if the same object needs to be created again. 
2. Tail-Log Backups were introduced in SQL Server 2005 
3. "Partial" backups which was introduced with SQL Server 2005. 
4. Checksum to verify physical pages (i.e. PAGE_VERIFY = CHECKSUM as default option will reduce manually running DBCC CHECKDB)  
      - Below are the guidelines on how to accomplish on SQL server 2005/2008 
        -- Perform incremental/differential backups each day, so that each page file will be read before making backup, if any issues detected, then page restore can be done using latest backups. 
        -- 2 more issues that can occur & only DBCC CHECKDB Can figure it out. (scribble error, Bugs in SQL Server) 
5. In-memory page scan to find checksum violations due to ECC failure that may happen during DML tasks. 
6. If the existing db was from earlier to SQL server 2005 or new version db that has no PAGE_VERIFY enabled then only page modify and page addition will be criteria for checksum, so any pages without checksum will be prone to corruption.
