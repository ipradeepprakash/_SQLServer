**************************************
        SQL Server 2012 
        Code Name  : Denalli 
        Year       : 2012 

Operating systems supports SQL Server 2012 
        - windows server2012

        - windows vista, windows 7, windows 8


NEW Features 
********************************************* 
    - Columnstore Indexes 
    - FileTable support to handle system files in SQL Server.  
    - AlwaysOn: Failover Cluster Instances, AlwaysOn : Availability Groups. 
    - Contained Databases 
    - In-memory  
    - Resource Governor Enhancements (Database Engine) 
  


New Method of DB Administrations
----------------------------------------------

1. Moving and copying Databases to other instances 
    old approach
    ------------------
    Sp_attach_db : will be discouraged from SQL server 2012. 

    New approach - 
    --------------------- 
      - Create database â€¦ for attach (which now supercedes sp_attach_db) 
      - Requires use of logical names (use sys.databases_files) 

2. Relocate database files within instance 
    Use alter database  
    Requires use of logical file names. 
  
    For moving system database files 
        Master db                 : requires setting startup options in SQL Server Configuration manager. 
        Other system databases    : require ALTER DATABASE and restart of SQL Server Agent. 



Enhancements 
-------------------------- 
    - Backup and Restore Enhancements ( Native backups to azure blob storage 
    - Online Index Create, Rebuild, and Drop 
    - semantic search is a feature included in Full text search to search in unstructured documents. 
    - Partition Support Increased (supports up to 15,000 partitions by default. In earlier versions, the number of partitions was limited to 1,000 by default.) 
    - FILESTREAM Filegroups Can Contain Multiple Files 
        **************************************** 
            > A FILESTREAM filegroup can contain more than one file. 
            > You can improve I/O scalability for FILESTREAM data by placing different files within the same FILESTREAM filegroup on different volumes. This feature eliminates the need for complicated workarounds that use partitioning and multiple FILESTREAM filegroups. 
    - Resource Governor Enhancements (Database Engine) 
        ************************************************ 
            > The enhancements to the Resource Governor enable you to more effectively govern performance in multi-tenancy environments like private cloud. The enhancements include support for 64 resource pools, greater CPU usage control, and resource pool affinity for partitioning of physical resources and predictable resource allocation.   
    - Online Index Create, Rebuild, and Drop 
        ************************** 
            > Indexes containing XML, varchar(max), nvarchar(max), and varbinary(max) columns can now be created, rebuilt, and dropped as an online operation. 
    - Contained Databases 
        ***************** 
            > Moving databases from one instance of the SQL Server Database Engine to another instance of the Database Engine is simplified by introducing contained databases. Users in a contained database are no longer associated with logins on the instance of SQL Server. Many other dependencies on the instance are also removed. 
    - Service Master Key and Database Master Key Encryption changes from 3DES to AES
        ******************************************************************************
            > SQL Server 2012 uses the AES encryption algorithm to protect the service master key (SMK) and the database master key (DMK).  
            > After upgrading an instance of the Database Engine to SQL Server 2012 the SMK and DMK should be regenerated in order to upgrade the master keys to AES. 

    - Certificates Can be Created from Binary 
            > CREATE CERTIFICATE (Transact-SQL) has the FROM BINARY option to allow specifying the binary description of an ASN encoded certificate. New functions CERTENCODED (Transact-SQL) and CERTPRIVATEKEY (Transact-SQL) can be used to extract a binary description of an existing certificate. 
    - Connect to the Database Engine Using Extended Protection 
            > Extended Protection uses service binding and channel binding to help prevent an authentication relay attack.
