# Notes - SQL 2022

## Amazing feature in SQLSERVER 2022 !! 
-----------------------------------------
- Did you face blockings while shrinking data file or database due to long running transaction? 
- We can avoid blockings by using the option WAIT_AT_LOW_PRIORITY in DBCC SHRINK . 
 

## Always On availability group : 
-------------------------------------
- Manages its own metadata objects (users, logins, permissions, SQL Agent jobs etc.) at the availability group level in addition to the instance level. 
- Includes specialized contained system databases within the availability group. 
- Contained Availability groups. ( This feature made DBA life easy while Always on fail over . )
